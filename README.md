# belly-button-challenge

An interactive dashboard was built with JavaScriptto explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

In this assignment the D3 library was used to read in from a JSON file.

The horizontal bar charts and the bubble charts both display the top 10 OTUs found in a selected individual

The demographic information panel updates whenever a new Subject ID is selected.

Below is an image showing the completed dashboard:
